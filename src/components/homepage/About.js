      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I am highly motivated web developer. I enjoy learning new programming
        concepts and have lots of experience working with other people in
        previous jobs. I spend a minimum of 14 hours a week developing my
        programming skills through courses and projects alongside my day-job. I
        have completed 15 courses in Python and web development. I am also part
        of an online community where I give and receive feedback on coding
        problems and projects.
